# data-entry-evaluation-program

This is an implementation of The Evaluation Form

It uses the Data Entry Form data file and calculates various parameters such as

1. Total number of records
2. Min, Max and Avg Data Entry times
3. Inter-record Min, Max and Avg times
4. Backspace Count 

It writes it back to the file CS6326Asg3.txt. If there is not one, it will create it for you.
